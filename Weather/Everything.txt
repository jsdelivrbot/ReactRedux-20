Redux contains our application state which is generated by serious of REDUCERS that we write. That state is then modify by calling ACTION CREATORS, ACTIONS CREATORS returns ACTIONS which flow throw MIDDLEWARE and then into REDUCERS.
Whenever a new setState is produced it flows into our CONTAINERS and those CONTAINERS re-render themselves and the entire process repites all over again.
