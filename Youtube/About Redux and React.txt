Redux contains the state of the application or the data that tell our components
how or what they should render
represents the views which translates the app's data into something that can be displayed on the screen as something that the user can actually interact with

When we have any other javascript library we alwayas have separated collections of data. Backbone has COLLECTIONS, Flux has different stores, angular ???.
Redux on the other hand centralizes all of this data into a central single objet which referred to as the state. (Application level state)
